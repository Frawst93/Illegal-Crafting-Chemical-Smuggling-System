# Mainframe RP - Blueprint Mission System

This QBCore resource adds blueprint acquisition missions that allow players to earn tradable/lootable blueprint items used to unlock illegal weapon crafting at player-owned benches.

## Features
- Multi-stage illegal missions (escort, warehouse raid, intel theft)
- Server-side police checks (min 3 on-duty required)
- Police alerts with mission-specific messages
- Blueprint items that can be traded, stored, or used at custom crafting benches

## Coming Soon
- Client-side crafting bench integration
- Illegal material gathering missions (chemical raids, truck hijacks)
